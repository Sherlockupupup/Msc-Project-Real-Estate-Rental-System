# project-1
This is my project in MSc HKBU, coding a real estate rental system that has three roles to use the system. One is the admin that can create, manage, view and delete the houses. User can view the houses shown in the first page or search houses by filtering their requirement. They also can rent a house and delete the house. Last one is vistor that only can view the houses and search it but cannot rent because they need to login to the site. Finally, I also develop it in the mobile site by using NativeScript. But due to the time limitation and project requirement, I just use Ngrok to share the data both in Web and Mobile terminal, i.e. If I create or rent a new house, the mobile terminal will immediately obtain the new message and update it.

### Version info

This app was originally generated on Thu Oct 10 2019 18:31:17 GMT+0800 (GMT+08:00) using Sails v1.2.3. And now I change the repository to a new one.

<!-- Internally, Sails used [`sails-generate@1.16.13`](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-generate/tree/v1.16.13/lib/core-generators/new). -->



<!--
Note:  Generators are usually run using the globally-installed `sails` CLI (command-line interface).  This CLI version is _environment-specific_ rather than app-specific, thus over time, as a project's dependencies are upgraded or the project is worked on by different developers on different computers using different versions of Node.js, the Sails dependency in its package.json file may differ from the globally-installed Sails CLI release it was originally generated with.  (Be sure to always check out the relevant [upgrading guides](https://sailsjs.com/upgrading) before upgrading the version of Sails used by your app.  If you're stuck, [get help here](https://sailsjs.com/support).)
